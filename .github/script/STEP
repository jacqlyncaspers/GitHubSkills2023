## Personal Bio
###### Hello! My name is Jacqlyn Caspers and I am a dual degree masters student (MFin/ MSBA) at the Tippie College of Business at The University of Iowa. I am also a Student-Athlete who plays volleyball for the university. I enjoy being outside, reading, and hanging out with my family when I have some free time. On this page you can see a description of a couple projects I worked on Fall 2022.

## Projects
1. Tableau - Housing Trends of DSM--
   My group looked at the housing trends of DSM from 2016-2019. My group and I looked at how different factors changed the price of a house in DSM. We looked at factors like square footage, location, school district, style of house, total number of rooms, bedrooms, bathrooms, and year built. We then visualized the data using Tableau and presented it to the class.
3. Python - Predicting the Outcome of a Volleyball Game-- My group and I used machine learning to determine if hitting percentage, number of errors, and total points scored had any correlation with the outcome of a volleyball game. We used Python to input, train, and test our data. We used a correlation matrix to make a final decision on whether or not there was a correlation and found out that hitting percentage and outcome of the game (win) had a very high correlation. Errors and total points scored also had a correlation, but not as strong as hitting percentage.
